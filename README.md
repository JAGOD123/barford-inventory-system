Need to start agauin effectively

It got too complicated with having the old system and trying to build the new system around it, sticky and awkward 

SO, we are going to start again
The Wearhouse will be a way to hold everything in one class, it will mabnage the logic with the orders and the stock which hasn't moved anywhere.
# Wearhouse
List of orders
List of items not in an order
*other potential attributes*


# Order
ID
List of items on order
Who currently has it
Who signed it out
start date 
end date


# Items
ID
Name
Description
Condition
Location
Pack QTN 


# THE PLAN

Need to create the system back to a pioint where we can then start making the database again. cus thats where the hiccup occured
So get a screen for viewing all the orders, when an order is viewed it should take us into a different screen which shows us the details of that order with the items.
Should be able to create an order, need to figure out the logic for adding items, have a list of all the items currently in storage and have them checked boxed for the user to pick whihc ones they want.

# MANTRAS
Comment code throughout, took a break from thuis project and itssuch a wall to come back into it.
Implement one system at a time and commit and push that with good commit message and comments. ALSO versions as well
Better naming of variables, if a listy is only used to show the ui the data then that should be reflected in the var name, if the var is used for accessing the database and only for making that brdige this should be communicated
